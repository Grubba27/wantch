# App to manage Movies that you want to Watch: Wantch

I'm creating this repository to teach Meteor, React, PWA, etc at an [event](https://www.even3.com.br/setec18) in Brazil.

To have a better developer experience we are using [meteor-webpack](https://github.com/ardatan/meteor-webpack) package.

Original code copied from [here](https://github.com/ardatan/meteor-webpack/tree/master/examples/react) thanks to [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)
